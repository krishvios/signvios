Instructions (Updated 12/02/2004)

The latest changes to PropertyManager necessitated changes
to the .xml files and the location where they are stored.

In short, the PropertyTable.xml file will no longer be delivered as part
of the installed software.  Rather it will be generated automatically from
the DefaultProperties.xml file the first time it starts up.  (FYI, 
DefaultTempTable.xml has been renamed to DefaultProperties.xml.)

The location where the PropertyManager's xml files will be stored is
the /etc/pm directory.

As root (su), execute these steps to prepare your Red Hat system:
mkdir /etc/pm
chown [insert your username here] /etc/pm

Then, as yourself (not root), copy the pm/xml/DefaultProperties.xml
file to the /etc/pm directory.

Similarly, for your nfs mounted version, create the
/arm926ejs/etc/pm directory, and copy DefaultProperties.xml file
to it.

For the rfs (root mounted) and flash mounted systems, the cypress
build process will automatically take care of this change.
